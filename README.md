Understanding Blockchain Technology:
Building Blockchain and Solidity Apps are making a world of Trust and Accountability.
.

History:

Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the presumed pseudonymous[1][2][3][4] person or persons who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation.[5]

Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto

Bitcoin White Paper: “To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power. “

What is a Blockchain Network?
Blockchain is a encrypted peer-to-peer network.

How Bitcoin Used Blockchain Technology?
Transactions in a Peer to Peer Network.
Money (Fiat) is a form of Transaction

How Etherium Used Blockchain Technology?

Like the cryptocurrency bitcoin, Ethereum is based on the blockchain, an immutable public ledger that records the movement of data. In Bitcoin’s case, that data represents currency, but Buterin proposed to build a platform that would keep track of everything from money and memberships to legal agreements and share certificates.


Vitalik Buterin Created the Ethereum protocol.

Ethereum takes Blockchain Technology to make
dAPPs, dOrganisations and Smart Contracts Transaction between parties without a Third Party intermediary or Governing Entity.

Smart Contract:
Nicholas "Nick" Szabo[1] is a computer scientist, legal scholar,[2] and cryptographer known for his research in digital contracts and digital currency.

A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement.

Blockchain Oracles:

A blockchain oracle is a third-party service that connects smart contracts with the outside world, primarily to feed information in from the world, but also the reverse. Information from the world encapsulates multiple sources so that decentralised knowledge is obtained

Chainlink:
The network is intended to be used to facilitate the transfer of tamper-proof data from off-chain sources to on-chain smart contracts.

Components of Blockchain Technology:
Blockchain + Oracle (I.e Chainlink) = Hybrid Contracts.

Utilizes:DeFi, NFT and DAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations:

DAO are oganization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government, in other words they are member-owned communities without centralized leadership

Utilities:
Decentralized.
Transparency & Flexibility.
Speed and Efficiency.
Security & Immutable.
Removal of counterparty risk.
Trust Minimized Agreement.

Ethereum Virual Machine (EVM)

Gas:
Krypton miners get paid for every computation that happens on the blockchain. This is represented in Gwei.

Adding value to cryptocurrencies. As a little bit of cryptocurrency is needed for the computation to happen and change a state in a blockchain.

The more computations the higher the gas fee or gwei. 

GWEI = Gas Price.

Hence why gas fees are lower when there is very little activity on the blockchain network.
